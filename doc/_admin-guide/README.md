This guide is intended for system administrators and consultants
responsible for designing and maintaining logging solutions and log
centers. It is also useful for IT decision makers looking for a tool to
implement centralized logging in heterogeneous environments.

The following skills and knowledge are necessary for a successful
syslog-ng administrator:

- At least basic system administration knowledge.

- An understanding of networks, TCP/IP protocols, and general network
    terminology.

- Working knowledge of the UNIX or Linux operating system.

- In-depth knowledge of the logging process of various platforms and
    applications.

- An understanding of the legacy syslog (BSD-syslog) protocol
    and the new syslog (IETF-syslog) protocol standard.

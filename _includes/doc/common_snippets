<!-- included common_snippets start 

This file is included to each layout, page and document using generate_helper.rb - GeneratorHelpers Jekyll plugin
that allows referencing all the variables defined here and in the subsequent includes 
in each of the above mentioned site page types

This is needed as the content of a simply included snippet will be seen only in the given layout, page, etc.
that contains the include tag, further inherited e.g. layouts will not see the included variables, etc.

<!-- FIXME: This, and any other includes with none purely variable assignements, will cause trouble now 
     because of the actual implementation of the generate_helper.rb GeneratorHelpers plugin
     The inclusion order must be corrected first
